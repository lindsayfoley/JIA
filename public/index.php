			<h2>Welcome to Jesus in Action</h2>
			<p>Every child has the right to a home and education and our aim is to make a positive and lasting change in the lives of the children we work with. By providing a safe and secure home, and by teaching them skills in a rural environment away from the city, we believe that we can help some of the most deprived children in Guyana.</p>
