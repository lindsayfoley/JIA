                        <p>Supporters of JIA in England have shipped several barrels of goods which have been distributed in the area. Donations of children's clothing (in a presentable condition) and tinned foods as we ship large barrels of these necessities to Guyana and share these amongst those who need it most.

                        <p>Volunteering your time and skills is a great way to make a real difference to the lives of children in Parika. You can volunteer for as long as you like and get involved in multiple areas, we are a very small team here so would love you to muck in! You will get the chance to meet new people and make contacts whilst making a valuable contribution.</p>
                        <p>Once our first home is up and running we will be taking on volunteers. Many of our activities will rely on volunteers to run and coordinate classes benefiting hugely from the personal and life experiences that a volunteer can bring.</p>
                        <p>You can volunteer in London, or if based in Guyana, you can help us too. If there are any areas where you think you could assist us, please <a href="mailto:info@jesusinaction.org.uk">contact us here</a> and we will contact you to discuss this further.</p>

                        <p>Fundraise for Jesus in Action and help us save and change children's lives in Guyana. We've got some great ideas here to inspire your next event... </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Get active</strong> - take on a physical challenge and raise money by being sponsored to get moving and active.</li>
                            <li><strong>Host a quiz or a sweepstakes</strong> - make it fun and bring out that competitive side, charging £1 per entry to find out who the winner will be.</li>
                            <li><strong>Organise an event</strong> - construct some engaging activities and invite your friends and family around. We recommend bake sales, raffles and little stalls to raise funds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arrange a dinner party</strong> - Don't eat out, instead have some folks around for dinner and rather than spending money on the bill ask your guests to make a donation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Promoting your fundraising is key! You can raise the profile of your event by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter and other social sites you may be on.</p>
