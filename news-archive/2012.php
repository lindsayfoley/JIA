			<p class="sub_header">Doors &amp; Windows</p>
			<p>Small increments of progress as funds came in, allowed us to fit windows with mosquito netting screens, and have the front and back doors made from the local hardwood - 
			purpleheart. (they look great). In the interior, the floors have been levelled, and the walls rendered. We have used concrete as much as possible to give the building longevity, 
			but the roof is supported with wooden rafters, and this fact has not been lost on the local wood ants who rapidly constructed covered walkways up the walls to make their journey 
			to lunch less hazardous! So now we are entering the long term maintenance phase of the build!</p>
