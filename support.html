				<h3>Help with donations</h3>
					<p class="sub_header">Money, clothes, food</p>
					<p>We are currently working on a Just Giving page to enable our 
charity to accept donations online, for the time being continue reading 
					to see the other available options.</p>
					<p>At present if you would like to make a donation we can accept 
cheque payments made payable to 'Jesus in Action Charity' or 'JIA'. You 
can also make a payment into our charity account, please email us for 
the account details.
					We are immensely grateful for any amount you choose to give. Please
 send us an email making a 'cheque donation' the subject title and we 
will 
					provide you with the main office address and details.</p>
					<p>Supporters of JIA in England have shipped several barrels of 
goods which have been distributed in the area. Donations of children's 
clothing 
					(in a presentable condition) and tinned foods as we ship large 
barrels of these necessities 
					to Guyana and share these amongst those who need it most. For a 
list of the food items that we can ship please <a href="mailto:info@jesusinaction.org.uk">send us an email</a> with 
					'other donation' as the subject line and we will respond back with the required details.</p>

					<h3>Help with your time</h3>
					<p class="sub_header">We need you!</p>
					<p>Volunteering your time and skills is a great way to make a real 
difference to the lives of children in Parika. You can 
					volunteer for as long as you like and get involved in multiple 
areas, we are a very small team here so would love you to muck in!
					You will get the chance to meet new people and make contacts whilst
 making a valuable contribution.</p>
					<p>Once our first home is up and running we will be taking on 
volunteers. Many of our activities will rely on volunteers to run and 
					coordinate classes benefiting hugely from the personal and life 
experiences that a volunteer can bring.</p>
					<p>You can volunteer in London, or if based in Guyana, you can help
 us too. If there are any areas where you think you could assist us, 
					please <a href="mailto:info@jesusinaction.org.uk">contact us here</a> and we will contact you to discuss this further.</p>

					<h3>Help with fundraising</h3>
					<p class="sub_header">Get involved</p>
					<p>Fundraise for Jesus in Action and help us save and change 
children's lives in Guyana. We've got some great ideas here to inspire 
your next event... </p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Get active</strong> - take on a physical challenge and raise money by being sponsored to get moving and active.</li>
						<li><strong>Host a quiz or a sweepstakes</strong> - make it fun and bring out that competitive side, charging £1 per entry to find out who the winner will be.</li>
						<li><strong>Organise an event</strong> - construct some engaging activities and invite your friends and family around. We recommend bake sales, raffles
						 and little stalls to raise funds.</li>
						<li><strong>Arrange a dinner party</strong> - Don't eat out, instead have some folks around for dinner and rather than spending money on the bill ask your 
						guests to make a donation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Promoting your fundraising is key! You can raise the profile of 
your event by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter and other social
					 sites you may be on.</p>
