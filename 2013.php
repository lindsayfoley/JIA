			<h3>News - 2013</h3>
			<p class="sub_header">Help with the plumbing!</p>
			<p>Plumber Mark Newlove, from Beckenham, UK, kindly came down to Guyana to help install the plumbing fittings. He had managed to persuade City Plumbing Supplies in 
			Beckenham to donate the necessary toilets, basins, and shower fittings for the building, and these were shipped down ahead of his arrival. Mark is seen here accompanied
			by JIA Trustees Pastor John Richards and Evangelist Debbie Rostron. The trustees spent a full week pleading with the Guyanese Revenue Authority to clear the shipment: 
			in the end the goods were released one day before Mark was due to fly back to the UK. Despite these setbacks, he worked long and hard in the tropical heat fitting 
			guttering and down-pipes, and made good progress in bringing the building nearer completion.</p>
